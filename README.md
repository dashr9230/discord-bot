# discord bot
 A Discord bot just for shits and giggles and lolz, I guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

 **This repo has been discontinued and deprecated, atleast for now.**
 All old and recently pushed files or code bits in commits not have been modified since november 2019.
 Even if the modules will run with the latest version of discord.py, some of the commands, like !youtube,
 which sends and receives data from the website, may not work anymore, even with 1.0.0a version of
 discord.py, which was this bot built on.
